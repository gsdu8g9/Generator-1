========================================================================
Generator - A YAML / Django Templates based text file generation tool.
========================================================================

Overview
--------

This project was initiated as I realized that I needed to have some kind of
simple code generation tool to use with our projects. I know there are lots of
tools out there, but after taking a short look of what's available I thought it
would be better to just use a few hours to make one myself.

I try to add some documentation here as the things progress, this is just the
first initial version that does something useful.

Usage
-----

To convert the given template file, run 

``python generator.py [options] inputfiles``

if you need help, type

``python generator.py --help``
